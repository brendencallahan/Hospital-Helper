# Hospital-Helper

## An app to help people with aphasia or anyone else that may find it useful.

#### Allow communication without words

This was built using Svelte with the design coming from Gary Simon*. It is meant to be used in instances where the person is unable to speak and therefore is entirely touch based, has large fonts, etc.

### Contributions always welcome!

### *Please checkout the original design, and all credit to Gary Simon. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JavCEJ5hodc
